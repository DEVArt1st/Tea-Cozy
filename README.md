# Tea Cozy Off-Platform Project

## Overview:
This was a project from Codecademy with which altered the way the project was to be completed. While this wasn't done so on the Codecademy platform, rather it drove me to complete the project off-platform on my own computer! Given the design spec and assets, I finished this project all by myself using my very own authentic code.
